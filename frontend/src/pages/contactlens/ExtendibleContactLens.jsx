                    <h2>Extended Wear Contact Lenses</h2>
                    <p>
                    Extended wear contact lenses are available for overnight or continuous wear 
                    ranging from one to six nights or up to 30 days. Extended wear contact lenses
                    are usually soft contact lenses. They are made of flexible plastics that allow 
                    oxygen to pass through to the cornea. There are also a very few rigid gas permeable 
                    lenses that are designed and approved for overnight wear. Length of continuous wear 
                    depends on lens type and your eye care professional’s evaluation of your tolerance for 
                    overnight wear. It’s important for the eyes to have a rest without lenses for at least one 
                    night following each scheduled removal.
