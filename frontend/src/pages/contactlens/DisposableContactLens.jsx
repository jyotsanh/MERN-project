            <h2>Disposable Contact Lenses</h2>
            <p>
            The majority of soft contact lens wearers are prescribed some type of frequent replacement 
            schedule. “Disposable,” as defined by the FDA, means used once and discarded.
             With a true daily wear disposable schedule, a brand new pair of lenses is used each day.
             Some soft contact lenses are referred to as “disposable”
              by contact lens sellers, but actually, they are for frequent/planned replacement.
